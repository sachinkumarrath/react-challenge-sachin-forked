[Intro](Technical_Screening)
Welcome to the Bottomline Technical Screening exercise.

We have created a basic project for you which consist of:

- public/index.html - main HTML file for the project.
- src/styles.css - basic CSS file that is imported into the index.html
- src/index.js - main javascript (that consist also the basic react logic).

The aim for this excerise is to complete below challenges.

[Challenges](Level_1)

> Challenge 1

Looks like the application is currently not compiling, could you please resolve the 'Element type is invalid' error.

> Challenge 2

Please update the header component in components/header.js to output/render a <header>Welcome to Bottomline</header> HTML node.

> Note: Your index.js already has the placeholder import as well as component reference, for it.

> Challenge 3

Please update the page styles to make the header and .App container center aligned and in 'Verdana' font.

> Challenge 4

We have a basic JS object located in index.js called transactionsData. Please convert this Object into dynamically generated unordered (ul) list that will display individual transaction items such as example below: (please use Array.map or Array.forEach):

> Note: You can insert the loop directly into the index.js render part.

<ul>
  <li>
    <span>[dynamic transaction name]</span>
    <span>[dynamic transaction amount]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    <span>[dynamic transaction name]</span>
    <span>[dynamic transaction amount]</span>
  </li>
</ul>

[Next](LEVEL_2)

> Challenge 5

1.) Seems like increment button does not work. Please fix it.

2.) Looks like our custom component (<Item prop={data} />) is currently not displaying please fix it.

3.) Looks like our props are not displaying, please correct it so our "Welcome to Bottomline!" appears correctly on the screen from within the <Item prop={data} />.

[Optional](LEVEL_3)

> Challenge 6

1.) Create 'delete' experience whereby your list contains a button that will delete the transaction and pushes into archived transaction array (archived) (src/index.js).

2.) Display the archived as a seperate component that dynamically renders the data.

3.) Refactor your code to pass all the provided Unit tests.
